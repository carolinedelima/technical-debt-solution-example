# Technical debt solution example

Technical debt is the **future cost you create when choosing a quick or easy solution today instead of a cleaner, more sustainable one**.

It’s like borrowing time:

* You move faster now.
* You pay for it later through harder changes, more bugs, and slower development.

It appears as:

* Messy or duplicated code
* Poor architecture decisions
* Missing tests
* Tight coupling
* Outdated dependencies

Not all technical debt is bad. Sometimes it’s a conscious trade-off to deliver faster. It becomes a problem when it’s unmanaged and starts slowing the team down.

In short:
**Technical debt is the extra effort you’ll have to spend in the future because of shortcuts taken in the past.**
